            <p>A home page is generally the main web page a visitor navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.[1][2] The home page is used to facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links to prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search box.[3] For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[4] Meanwhile, other websites use the home page to attract users to create an account. Once they are logged in, the home page may be redirected to their profile page. When a web browser is launched, it may automatically open at least one web page, sometimes referred to as a "start page". Start pages can be a website or a special browser page, such as thumbnails of frequently visited websites. Moreover, there is a niche market of websites intended to be used solely as start pages.Website is a hyper-media information storage system linking resources around the world. In website, browsers allow highlighted words or an icon which is called hyper links to display text, video, graphics and sound on a local computer screen. With the introduction of World Wide Web in 1989, the concept of websites has become more popular. On this web, anyone can create a home page, which millions of users can watch on their computers and respond </p>

        <div id="login"><span>Login</span>
            <p>Logging in is usually used to enter a specific page, website or application, which trespassers cannot see. Once the user is logged in, the login token may be used to track what actions the user has taken while connected to the site. Logging out may be performed explicitly by the user taking some actions, such as entering the appropriate command or clicking a website link label as such. It can also be done implicitly, such as by the user powering off his or her workstation, closing a web browser window, leaving a website, or not refreshing a website within a defined period.

                In the case of websites that use cookies to track sessions, when the user logs out, session-only cookies from that site will usually be deleted from the user's computer. In addition, the server invalidates any associations with the session, thereby making any session-handle in the user's cookie store useless. This feature comes in handy if the user is using a public computer or a computer that is using a public wireless connection. As a security precaution, one should not rely on implicit means of logging out of a system, especially not on a public computer; instead, one should explicitly log out and wait for the confirmation that this request has taken place.
                
                Logging out of a computer, when leaving it, is a common security practice preventing unauthorised users from tampering with it. There are also people who choose to have a password-protected screensaver set to activate after some period of inactivity, thereby requiring the user to re-enter his or her login credentials to unlock the screensaver and gain access to the system. There can be different methods of logging in that may be via image, fingerprints, eye scan, password (oral or textual input), etc.</p>

        <div id="register"><span>Register</span>
            <p>When discussing the register of a word, we refer to the use of language for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting, that is, its level of formality. The English language is no exception when it comes to language variation and style and it is important to recognise the differences and just as important to know the differences.

                Consider the table below and the grade differences ranging from very formal to casual in salutations and closures in both spoken and written discourse.An important feature of writing at university is its style and register. The choice of register for a particular text or part of text will vary depending on the genre and who will be reading the text. Therefore, knowing the targeted audience before starting the writing process, will have an impact on the stylistic choices.

                When referring to register in writing, the choices are usually 'familiar', 'informal', 'formal' and 'ceremonial'. However, the two registers that are commonly crossed in academic writing are generally between formal and informal; therefore, a standard guideline of the stylistic differences between the two have been provided, plus a simple guide of cross registering examples.</p>
